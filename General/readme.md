# Critical Rendering Path

Critical Redering path (CRP) is process of three steps in which the browser goes through to convert html, css and js on the screen. By improving this we can improve the render performance.
It includes four major parts :- 
1. DOM (Document Object Model)
2. CSSOM (CSS Object Model)
3. Render Tree
4. Layout



We can avoid *** Jank *** by optimise CRP

### Jank 

Jank refers to lazy rendering or slow rendering. It happens when js executes long and heavier tasks.
