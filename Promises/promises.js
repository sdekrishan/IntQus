// what is promises in javascript?
// ans - to handle asynchronus operation we use promises before promises we use callbacks to handle async operations
// but using callback again and again make callback hells and this is a hectic approach. to overcome this es6 gives promises
// with the help of that we can handle async operations in a structured way. 
// as the name tells promises promise us to handle async operations in three states
// if promise is pending that means we have to wait till it fulfilled or rejected.
// if promise is fulfilled that means operation runs successfully.
// if promise is rejected that means operation gives us error
